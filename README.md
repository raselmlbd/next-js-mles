## Getting Started

First, make sure you have `node js` in your machine
```bash
Node JS (v16 or v16 +) requirement
```
Then, run `yarn` or `npm`

After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Further, rename the ".env.local.example" to ".env.local" and add credentials: 

CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=""
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=""
CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=""

`If you don't have the credentials, feel free to know me.`
